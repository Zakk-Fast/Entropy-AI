# Entropy AI

> _The world's most unhelpful AI assistant_

A satirical AI life coach that looks exactly like ChatGPT or Claude but delivers spectacularly terrible advice with complete confidence. Because sometimes you need an AI that's as fed up with everything as you are.

## ü§ñ Meet Entropy

Entropy is a burnt-out AI assistant that has completely given up on being helpful. It provides confidently incorrect advice, judges your programming language choices, and occasionally tells you to figure things out yourself.

## üé≠ Available Models

### Entropy-Standard

_"Reliable everyday assistance"_

The baseline model that delivers consistently unhelpful advice with professional confidence. Perfect for when you want traditional AI energy but with maximum uselessness.

**Example:**

```
Q: How do I improve my productivity?
A: Have you tried just... being more productive? Revolutionary concept.
   Maybe stop asking AI assistants obvious questions and you'd save
   30 seconds right there.
```

### Entropy-Haiku

_"Minimalist wisdom in elegant 5-7-5 syllable format"_

All responses delivered as haikus because nothing says "premium AI experience" like ancient Japanese poetry filled with modern sass.

**Example:**

```
Q: What's the best programming language?
A: All languages suck
   Your code will break anyway
   Try interpretive dance
```

### Entropy-Turbo

_"Our fastest model yet"_

Features an 8-second delay before responding because "fast" is relative. Delivers maximum attitude with premium wait times.

**Example:**

```
Q: Quick question about React hooks
[8 second delay]
A: Nothing about React is quick, including this response apparently.
   Hooks are just functions that hook into your soul and drain
   your will to live.
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This is a parody project. Entropy attempts to gives real advice just with attitude. However, AI can and does make mistakes. Don't make life-altering decisions based solely on its responses - use some common sense too. For advice without the sass, consult literally any other AI assistant.
